# IDLE v1 — Single Daily Session

This document records the changes made to remove morning/evening session concepts and implement a single, time-neutral daily session.

---

## Summary

IDLE now offers exactly ONE daily session with no time-of-day labeling. The session is neutral and works at any time of day. Users are never asked to choose a session type.

---

## Removed Logic

### 1. Session Type Selection
- **Deleted:** `components/SessionPicker.tsx`
  - Previously offered "Prime" (Morning reset) and "Decompress" (Evening reset)
  - Users had to choose between two session types
  - Now removed entirely

### 2. Time-Based Session Defaults
- **Removed from `app/home/page.tsx`:**
  ```javascript
  // REMOVED:
  function getDefaultSession(): 'prime' | 'decompress' {
    const hour = new Date().getHours();
    return hour < 12 ? 'prime' : 'decompress';
  }
  ```
  - Previously auto-selected session type based on time of day
  - Removed `defaultSession` variable
  - Removed "Morning reset" / "Evening reset" footer label

### 3. Session Mode URL Parameters
- **Removed from `app/session/run/page.tsx`:**
  - Previously: `/session/run?mode=prime` or `/session/run?mode=decompress`
  - Now: `/session/run` (no parameters)
  - Removed `useSearchParams` import
  - Removed mode-based config lookup

### 4. Dual Session Configuration
- **Simplified in `app/session/run/page.tsx`:**
  ```javascript
  // BEFORE:
  const SESSION_CONFIG: Record<string, {...}> = {
    prime: { title: 'Prime', subtitle: 'Morning Focus', ... },
    decompress: { title: 'Decompress', subtitle: 'Evening Reset', ... },
  };

  // AFTER:
  const SESSION_CONFIG = {
    src: '/audio/guided-session.m4a',
    title: 'Reset',
    subtitle: '7 minutes',
  };
  ```

## New Simplified Session Logic

### Session Flow
1. User opens app → sees home screen
2. Taps "Begin" → navigates to `/session/run`
3. Single 7-minute guided session plays
4. On completion → session is logged, returns to home

### Session Availability
- One session unlocks per day
- After completion, home shows "Reset complete" state
- User can reset again if desired (button changes to "Reset again")
- No pressure, no streak language

### Readiness States
```javascript
type ReadinessState = 'idle' | 'completed';

const STATE_COPY = {
  idle: {
    centerText: 'Ready when you are',
    buttonLabel: 'Begin',
    buttonDuration: '7 min',
  },
  completed: {
    centerText: 'Reset complete',
    buttonLabel: 'Reset again',
    buttonDuration: null,
  },
};
```

## Updated Onboarding Copy

### Welcome Overlay (`components/WelcomeOverlay.tsx`)
- **Before:** "a short daily reset. nothing to achieve."
- **After:** "one session. once a day. nothing to achieve."

### Landing Page (`app/home/page.tsx`)
- Headline: "Seven minutes. Once a day."
- Subhead: "A daily pause for the mind"
- Reassurance 1: "There's nothing to learn and nothing to get right."
- Reassurance 2: "You simply begin — and return."

### Session Page (`app/session/page.tsx`)
- Title: "Session"
- Duration: "7 minutes"
- Button: "Begin" with subtitle "Daily reset"
- Hint: "Audio guided · One session per day"

---

## Updated Session Description Copy

### During Session (`app/session/run/page.tsx`)
- Title: "Reset"
- Subtitle: "7 minutes"
- No time-of-day labeling
- Neutral, works any time

### Home Screen
- No "Morning reset" / "Evening reset" labels
- Simple "Begin" or "Reset again" button
- Duration shown as "7 min" only in idle state

---

## Copy & Tone Guidelines Applied

### Preferred Language
- begin, return, reset, pause, continue
- clarity, stillness, space
- Factual, calm, understated

### Avoided Language
- improve, optimize, boost, achieve, unlock
- train, performance, productivity, focus (as verbs)
- Exclamation marks, enthusiasm, celebration
- "Great job!", "You did it!", "Keep going!"
- Morning, evening, AM, PM, time-of-day references

## Files Modified

1. `app/home/page.tsx` — Removed time-based session selection
2. `app/session/page.tsx` — Replaced SessionPicker with single session button
3. `app/session/run/page.tsx` — Simplified to single session config
4. `components/WelcomeOverlay.tsx` — Updated onboarding copy
5. `components/SessionPicker.tsx` — **DELETED**

---

## Assumptions Made

1. **Audio file remains the same:** Both Prime and Decompress used the same audio file (`guided-session.m4a`), so no audio changes needed.

2. **Stats logic unchanged:** The existing stats system (streaks, sessionsToday, totalFocusSeconds) works correctly with a single session model.

3. **Multiple sessions per day allowed:** Users can complete multiple sessions per day if desired. The "completed" state shows "Reset again" rather than blocking.

4. **No scheduling features:** No reminders, notifications, or preferred time selection — aligned with product guardrails.
